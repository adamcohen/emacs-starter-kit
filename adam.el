;; COPYING LINES WITHOUT SELECTING THEM
;; http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com/2009/11/copying-lines-without-selecting-them.html
;; When I'm programming, I often need to copy a line. Normally, this requires me to first select ('mark') the line I want to copy. That does not seem like a big deal, but when I'm in the 'flow' I want to avoid any little obstacle that can slow me down.

;; So, how can I copy the current line without selection? I found a nice trick by MacChan on EmacsWiki to accomplish this. It also adds ta function to kill (cut) the current line (similar to kill-line (C-k), but kills the whole line, not just from point (cursor) to the end.

;; The code below simply embellishes the normal functions with the functionality 'if nothing is selected, assume we mean the current line'. The key bindings stay the same (M-w, C-w).

;; To enable this, put the following in your .emacs:

(defadvice kill-ring-save (before slick-copy activate compile) "When called
  interactively with no active region, copy a single line instead."
  (interactive (if mark-active (list (region-beginning) (region-end)) (message
  "Copied line") (list (line-beginning-position) (line-beginning-position
  2)))))

(defadvice kill-region (before slick-cut activate compile)
  "When called interactively with no active region, kill a single line instead."
  (interactive
    (if mark-active (list (region-beginning) (region-end))
      (list (line-beginning-position)
        (line-beginning-position 2)))))

;; DUPLICATING LINES AND COMMENTING THEM
;; http://emacs-fu.blogspot.com/
;; Someone on the Emacs Help mailing list asked for an easy way to duplicate a line
;; and, optionally, comment-out the first one.

;; I hacked up something quickly to solve both questions, and it has evolved a
;; little bit since – to answer both of the questions. The bit of weirdness in
;; the end is because of the special case of the last line in a buffer. It
;; defines key bindings C-c y for duplicating a line, and C-c c for
;; duplicating + commenting – but of course you can change those.
